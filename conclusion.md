# Conclusion

### Well done

-  Structured Constants:
The DecisionEngineConstants class neatly organizes all the constants used in the decision engine, facilitating easier management and updates in the future.


-  Robust Error Handling:
Comprehensive error handling has been implemented in the DecisionEngine service class to manage various error scenarios effectively. It provides appropriate error messages for different types of invalid inputs or unexpected errors, enhancing the reliability and user experience of the application.


- Javadoc Documentation:
The codebase includes Javadoc documentation, offering clear guidelines on the usage, input parameters, and expected output of each method. This documentation enhances readability, maintainability, and understanding of the codebase for developers and contributors.


- Separate Methods:
The code in the DecisionEngine service class is structured into separate methods, with each method responsible for a specific task. This approach promotes code reuse, maintainability, and readability, making it easier to understand and modify the codebase as needed.


- Tests:
The test suite covers various scenarios, including valid and invalid inputs, edge cases, and exceptions. These tests ensure that the DecisionEngine class behaves as expected under different conditions, contributing to the reliability and correctness of the implementation.


### Improvements

- Code Readability:
Certain sections of the code, particularly within the DecisionEngine class, might benefit from refactoring to enhance readability and maintainability. Simplifying complex methods into smaller, more targeted ones and employing meaningful method.


- Spring request validation:
Spring request validation validates incoming requests effectively, ensuring data integrity and security.


- logging mechanisms:
Is essential for monitoring, debugging, security, compliance, and performance optimization purposes, ultimately contributing to the reliability, security, and effectiveness of the software system.


- Dependency Injection:
In the DecisionEngineController class, the use of constructor injection for dependencies is good practice. However, injecting the DecisionResponse dependency might not be necessary, as it could be created within the method scope instead of being injected as a bean.


- Code Duplication:
The calculateApprovedLoan method exhibits redundancy in error handling logic. Extracting common error-handling code into helper methods could enhance maintainability by reducing duplication.


- Error handling:
Improving error handling involves providing more specific error messages. Distinguishing between server-side errors, validation errors, and business logic errors can aid users and developers in better understanding and addressing issues.


- Duplicate classes
DecisionResponse should accord to the requirements:returns a decision (negative or positive) and the amount, and the Decision class IS not necessary.
